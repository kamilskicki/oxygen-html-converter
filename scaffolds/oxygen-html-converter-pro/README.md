# Oxygen HTML Converter Pro (Starter)

This folder is a starter scaffold for a **separate private repository**.

## How to use

1. Copy this folder into a new repo named `oxygen-html-converter-pro`.
2. Keep it as a standalone plugin in `wp-content/plugins/oxygen-html-converter-pro`.
3. Require `oxygen-html-converter` core plugin to be active.
4. Add premium functionality by hooking Core actions and filters.

## Notes

- Do not vendor-lock Pro logic inside Core.
- Keep shared contracts in Core hooks and documented payload shapes.
- Version Pro independently from Core.
- Keep code licensing WordPress-compatible (GPL); monetize through licensing, support, and premium capabilities.
